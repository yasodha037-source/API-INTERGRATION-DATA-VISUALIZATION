**API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION(WEATHER APPLICATION)

The Weather Application project is a web based system developed to provide real time weather information for any city entered by the user. This project is designed using Python as the main programming language and Flask as the backend web framework. The main purpose of this application is to demonstrate how external APIs can be integrated with a backend server and how the retrieved data can be displayed dynamically on a web interface. Weather information such as temperature and humidity is very useful for daily planning, and this application presents that data in a simple and user friendly manner.

FRONTEND:
The frontend of the application is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used to design the structure of the webpage, CSS is used to style and arrange the elements neatly, and JavaScript is used to handle user interaction and dynamic updates. The user enters the city name in an input box and clicks the Get Weather button. JavaScript then sends a request to the Flask backend using the Fetch API without reloading the page. This ensures a smooth and interactive user experience.

BACKEND:
The backend of the project is built using Flask, which is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. Flask handles routing, processes user requests, and communicates with the OpenWeather API. The OpenWeather API is used to fetch real time weather data for the entered city. The API returns data in JSON format, which includes various weather parameters. From this response, the application extracts important details such as temperature in Celsius and humidity percentage. The processed data is then sent back to the frontend as a JSON response.

KEY FEATURES:
One of the key features of this project is data visualization. The application uses Chart.js, a JavaScript charting library, to display weather information in the form of a bar chart. The bar chart visually represents temperature and humidity values, making it easier for users to understand and compare the data. The chart is displayed alongside the textual weather information on the same screen, ensuring clarity and better presentation.

The development of this project was done using Visual Studio Code as the code editor and Google Chrome as the testing browser. GitHub was used as the version control platform to manage and store the project files. This project helps in understanding important concepts such as frontend and backend integration, API usage, asynchronous data fetching, and basic data visualization.

In conclusion, the Weather Application project is a practical and beginner friendly web application that demonstrates real world API integration using Python Flask. It provides accurate weather data in both text and graphical formats and can be further enhanced by adding more features such as weather forecasts, wind speed, and deployment on cloud platforms. Overall, this project strengthens problem solving skills, improves understanding of full stack development, and builds confidence in working with real time APIs. It also serves as a strong foundation for advanced projects in web development, data visualization, and API based applications suitable for academic submission and practical learning purposes.
